# App Store Review Response (Short Version for App Store Connect)

**Response to Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage:**

We have completely revised the app to make registration **completely optional**. Users can now access all app features without creating an account.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed mandatory registration requirement
- After onboarding, users go directly to Home screen with full app access
- All features (recommended places, map, mood selection, mood calendar, saved places) work without registration
- Registration is now optional and available only from Settings screen
- Registration only provides profile personalization (name, photo, about) and activity statistics

**How to Test:**
1. Complete onboarding → You'll be taken directly to Home screen
2. All features are immediately accessible without any registration
3. To register (optional): Settings → "Create Account" button
4. Users can logout/delete account and continue using app without registration

The app now fully complies with App Store guidelines. No personal information is required to use the app. Registration is purely optional for profile personalization only.
