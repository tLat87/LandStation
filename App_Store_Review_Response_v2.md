# App Store Review Response - Version 2

**Subject: Response to App Review - Guideline 5.1.1 - Data Collection and Storage**

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your review feedback. We have addressed the issue mentioned in your review and have updated the app accordingly. Below is a detailed explanation of the changes made:

## Issue: Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

**Issue Description:** The app requires users to register or log in to access features that are not account based.

**Resolution:**
We have completely revised the app to make registration **completely optional**. Users can now access all app features without creating an account. Registration is only available as an optional feature for users who want to personalize their profile.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Mandatory Registration:**
   - After completing onboarding, users are now taken directly to the Home screen
   - All app features are immediately accessible without registration
   - Users can browse recommended places, view the map, select moods, view mood calendar, and access all content without any account

2. **Optional Registration:**
   - Registration is now completely optional and can be accessed from the Settings screen
   - Users who choose not to register can still use all features of the app
   - Users who register can personalize their profile (name, photo, about) and see activity statistics

3. **Data Handling:**
   - Mood entries and saved places are stored locally on the device
   - These features work for both registered and non-registered users
   - Registration only adds profile personalization and activity statistics

### How to Test:

1. **Without Registration:**
   - Complete onboarding screens
   - You will be taken directly to Home screen
   - All features are accessible:
     - Recommended places
     - Map view
     - Mood selection
     - Mood calendar
     - Saved places
     - About app
   - No registration prompt appears

2. **Optional Registration:**
   - Navigate to Settings (from Home screen)
   - Tap "Create Account" button (only visible if not registered)
   - Complete registration (all fields are optional)
   - Profile will be personalized with your information

3. **Account Management:**
   - Registered users can logout or delete account from Settings
   - After logout, users can continue using the app without registration
   - Users can create an account again anytime from Settings

### User Flow:

**New User (No Registration):**
Onboarding → Home → All Features Available

**User Who Wants to Register:**
Onboarding → Home → Settings → Create Account → Profile Personalized

**Registered User:**
Home → Settings → View Profile & Statistics → Logout/Delete Account (optional)

## Summary

The app now fully complies with App Store guidelines. Users are not required to provide any personal information to use the app. Registration is purely optional and only provides profile personalization features. All core functionality is available without registration.

We believe these changes fully address the issue raised in your review. The app now provides a complete user experience without requiring any account creation.

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to your approval.
